# vim
This is my .vim directory.  It is a version of https://github.com/farazdagi/vim-go-ide
using vim-plug instead of an install script.

The repository also contains the .vimrc.  You can either link/copy it to your
home directory or create an alias if you are using a unix flavour.  My alias
says:

```
alias vim='vim -u ~/.vim/.vimrc'
```
